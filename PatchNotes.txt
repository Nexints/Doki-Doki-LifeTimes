0.2.0 Codename "Reworked":
- Included patch notes inside game package
- Rewrote the beginnning, changed beginning player name to current username, most of Sayori's route, other segments of this mod and removed the confession. (Confession will come back later, but not at the next update.)
- Included the framework for the phone system (Better EMR Phone by Elckarow, found at https://github.com/Elckarow/Better-EMR-Phone). Will be implemented in the next update!
- Updated credits accordingly.
- Improved on lore a lot more. The story should actually make more sense now, while still keeping the original ideas!
- Included Sayori's POV! (POV Swaps taken from Lost Ascension POV swaps)
- Improved pacing (albeit time skips still exist due to the length of the mod)
- Squashed more bugs
- Added additional lore.
- Next update may rework the phone system and other areas which still need updating.
(Important: Massive update, expect potential bugs with this update. Older versions are available at the releases tab.)
- Doki Doki LifeTimes has been shortened to DDLT
Notes:
- This update focuses heavily on Sayori's route as a childhood best friend. Other dokis as childhood best friends will be possible, albeit done at a later point in time. For now, I'm focused on Sayori's path.
- I'm still a solo developer (as of now), and while I have used other assets from various sources (found in the credits.txt document), I have done all of the scripting and writing by myself.
- If something looks off in this mod, please don't be afraid to let me know! Constructive criticism is always appreciated, but unjustified hate isn't.
- Next update focuses on fixing up character positions.
