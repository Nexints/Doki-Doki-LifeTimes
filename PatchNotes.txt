DDLT Patch Notes:

0.2.1 "RW":
- Massively improved other parts of Sayori's route!
- Fixed major bug with current user name collection.
- Finished the rewrite started in 0.2.0
- Uploaded to main DDLT github branch, and created an actual release.
- Fixed Patchnotes
Notes:
- Phone system and custom videos have been rescheduled for 0.2.2
- Rainclouds included. Please let me know if my interpretation is wrong!
- Stats may potentially be included.
- Past this point, I'll be working on custom DDLT music and videos in order to suit the game's massive length. I'm also likely going to improve the story externally and work on other projects, so new releases may not come for an extended period of time.
- I also have a lack of time to work on this mod, so new releases will be heavily delayed. I still wish to hear feedback though!

0.2.0 Codename "Reworked":
- Included patch notes inside game package
- Rewrote the beginnning, changed beginning player name to current username, most of Sayori's route, other segments of this mod and removed the confession. (Confession will come back later, but not at the next update.)
- Included the framework for the phone system (Better EMR Phone by Elckarow, found at https://github.com/Elckarow/Better-EMR-Phone). Will be implemented in the next update!
- Updated credits accordingly.
- Improved on lore a lot more. The story should actually make more sense now, while still keeping the original ideas!
- Included Sayori's POV! (POV Swaps taken from Lost Ascension POV swaps)
- Improved pacing (albeit time skips still exist due to the length of the mod)
- Squashed more bugs
- Added additional lore.
- Next update may rework the phone system and other areas which still need updating.
(Important: Massive update, expect potential bugs with this update. Older versions are available at the releases tab.)
- Doki Doki LifeTimes has been shortened to DDLT
Notes:
- This update focuses heavily on Sayori's route as a childhood best friend. Other dokis as childhood best friends will be possible, albeit done at a later point in time. For now, I'm focused on Sayori's path.
- I'm still a solo developer (as of now), and while I have used other assets from various sources (found in the credits.txt document), I have done all of the scripting and writing by myself.
- If something looks off in this mod, please don't be afraid to let me know! Constructive criticism is always appreciated, but unjustified hate isn't.
- Next update focuses on fixing up character positions.
