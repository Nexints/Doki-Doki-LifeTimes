# Doki Doki LifeTimes

This serves as the official Github repo for Doki Doki LifeTimes, an upcoming DDLC mod worked on by Nexint. We're still in our early stages, so issues will be present in the mod and characters may not act like themselves. Feedback is appreciated on this actively developing mod!

# Jist of the mod

You’ve only seen one side of the DDLC cast. What will you do when you’re with them for their entire life? Will you make the right choices? Can you change their future, and maybe, see a whole new reality with your favorite Doki?

# Copyright / IP Guidelines Issues:
- Please contact CircularSpace@proton.me if there are any copyright issues in this modpack, and I will try to resolve them as fast as I can.
- Alternatively, contact @Nexint on Discord to solve copyright problems.

# Additional notes
- I've open sourced this project and released what I had in order to show that mod development is ongoing. This mod is not ready for public release, and still uses plenty of placeholders.
