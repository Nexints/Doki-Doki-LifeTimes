# Doki Doki LifeTimes

This serves as the official Github repo for Doki Doki LifeTimes, an upcoming DDLC mod worked on by Nexint. We're still in our early stages, so issues will be present in the mod and characters may not act like themselves. Feedback is appreciated on this actively developing mod!

# Disclaimer
- This mod does not claim to replace DDLC in any way, shape or form. This mod assumes you have played through the original game, and may contain spoilers for DDLC.
- DDLC files are required to play this mod. You may download DDLC at https://ddlc.moe/.
- This mod is free forever, and (currently) open source.

# Jist:

You’ve only seen one side of the DDLC cast. What will you do when you’re with them for their entire life? Will you make the right choices? Can you change their future, and maybe, see a whole new reality with your favorite Doki?

# Plans for the mod:
- Each character will have a positive, negative and date route.
- Neutral routes are possible, where you don't date any character.
- Comedic routes (ie: American Route, etc).
- Wallace gets a few route here! He has a epiphany, and so he's no longer a jerk. (He also serves as the boss in the pre-lore.)
- Each doki could be brought back into the "real world" to live with the player.
- Alternatively, in the neutral route, the MC could bring all the dokis to the real world, albeit the MC won't be able to date any of them.
- Tragic routes are possible, where some of the dokis die. All tragic routes are avoidable in this mod though.
- Marrying one of the dokis (and more!) is possible in the final release of this mod. However, that may not happen for a while.
- There will be no harems in this mod (as in, you can't date all of the Dokis). The neutral route serves as a middle ground, where you're friends with (but don't date) all the dokis.

# Copyright / IP Guidelines Issues:
- Contact CircularSpace@proton.me if there are any copyright issues in this mod, and I will try to resolve them as fast as I can. (Suggested method of communication!)
- Alternatively, contact @Nexint on Discord to solve copyright problems.

# Additional notes:
- I've open sourced this project and released what I had in order to show that mod development is ongoing. This mod is not ready for public release, and still uses plenty of placeholders.
- I may eventually drop development on this mod, and if I do so, you may fork this project and continue it yourself.
- Contact me if you would like to join the development team!
